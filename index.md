## About Me

I am a PhD student at the **School of Information, University of Michigan**, advised by [Nicole Ellison](https://www.si.umich.edu/people/nicole-ellison). My research explores the **socio-technical and relational aspects** of building bonding relationships in Computer-Mediated and Human-Machine interaction environments.

My work sits at the intersection of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, **Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)**, **Communication**, and **Social Psychology**. I'm particularly interested in understanding how technology can foster meaningful connections and support community building in digital spaces.

Previously, I investigated sociocultural factors in digital skills learning, focusing on bonding relationships and social support in underresourced communities through community-based participatory research methods. Before returning to graduate school, I gained valuable industry experience as a product manager and communication specialist, bringing a unique perspective to my academic work.
